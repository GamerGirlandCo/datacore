Datacore is a *metadata* index - it stores information about every page, section, block, list item, canvas file, and other file in your vault
in an internal database which can be quickly searched for generating nice-looking views. You access this metadata using the [query language](query.md),
and then compile it into useful views using the [embedded views](code-views/index.md).
